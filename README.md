# oculus-haunted-house
With previous success at OHI/O where we built a "Mixed Reality Chess Set", our team decided to take a step further and enter the world of Virtual Reality.

This project involves a Scary Horror House where the user has to play a game in order to survive from a monster. The user is trapped in a room and the only way out is to solve "Simon says" challenge after which the user can exit and run for their life.

The project involved the use of the following tools and technologies:

Unity
C#
Blender
Oculus Rift VR Set
XBox Controller
3-D Modelling and State Space
The project involved designing a room, creating scary atmosphere including sound effects, lighting effects as well as integration of gameplay with concepts of physics.

The project was designed and developed by:

Danny Flax
Yashvardhan Gusani
Ben Stammen
Brian Lutz
The final version of the project can be found in the last commit of "Working" directory. Note: Master is not the root.
